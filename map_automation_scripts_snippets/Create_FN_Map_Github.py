#   This script will create the FN Map and evaluate the intersection with UWR, WMA, and OGMA

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# * SUMMARY

            # The provided script is designed to create a First Nations (FN) Map and evaluate the intersection of the map with various environmental layers such as 
            # Ungulate Winter Range (UWR), Wildlife Management Areas (WMA), and Old Growth Management Areas (OGMA). 
            # The script begins by importing necessary libraries, including arcpy, which is essential for geographic data analysis and manipulation in ArcGIS.

            # The script starts by defining several variables that need to be updated each time the script is run, such as proponent_id, 
            # proponent_input, and cp_ID. These variables are used to create a unique identifier string, permit_str, which is used throughout the 
            # script to name files and directories. The script also sets up the ArcGIS project and workspace, and assigns various layers and data sources to variables.

            # The script includes a function to create a new directory for storing output files. If a directory already exists for the given permit_str, 
            # a new subdirectory is created with the current date appended to its name. This ensures that the script does not overwrite existing data.

            # Next, the script sets up a definition query on the "Cutting Permit Application" layer to filter features based on the proponent_id and cp_ID.
            # The selected features are then copied to a new shapefile in the output directory.

            # The script includes several functions to evaluate intersections with different environmental layers. The chekUWR function evaluates intersections with 
            # the UWR layer, while the checkWMA function evaluates intersections with the WMA layer. Both functions use spatial queries to select intersecting features and print relevant attributes.

            # The appraisalArea function is used to evaluate the appraisal area for cutting permits. 
            # It creates a temporary feature layer, calculates the area of the selected features, and checks if the area exceeds a specified threshold. If the area is too large, non-timber harvesting land base (THLB) areas are removed, and the area is recalculated.

            # The script also includes functions to update the data source for a specific layer in the map and to export the permit features to a KMZ file for use in Google Earth. 
            # The update_application_layer_connection function updates the connection properties of the "FN Selected Features" layer to point to the new shapefile. 
            # The fn_make_kmz function exports the permit features to a KMZ file with applied symbology.

            # Finally, the script saves a copy of the ArcGIS project file to the output directory and prints a completion message. 
            # This ensures that all changes made during the script execution are saved and can be reviewed later.

# * HISTORY

#February 2nd, 2024
    # Changed the process of using a def query to find the cutting permit to make temp feature layer
    # Script will start by creating a temp feature layer with the proponent_id and cp_ID
    # Then it will use the temp feature layer to create a new shapefile in the project output folder
    # The temp  shapefile will be used to evaluate the intersection with UWR, WMA, 
    
# February 5th, 2024
    # Finished up to but not including the appraisal area tool

# February 6th, 2024
    # Got most of the way through the appraisal area tool, it is working up to the commented point
    # Accidentally committed to the appraisal area branch, need to merge the two branches together

# February 9th
    # Updated the script into functions
    # Added Create FN Appraisal Area function
    # Added Create Selected FN Features function
    
# February 13th 
    # Fixed attribute table of selected FN Features formatting
    
# February 14th
    # Added the creation of the permit features via def query
    # Created a proper FN folder based on the original format
    # Went through appraisals and updated all of the variables to point to new directories
    # redirected the directory for selected fn features from fgdb to permit dir
    # Added the update application layer connection function - currently not working
    
# February 15th
#     Now saves aprx to the permit_dir folder
#     Saves .kml to the permit_dir folder
#     Update the application layer is working
    


# Need to do
    # Change the name in the layout to application
    # Use update data source and data driven pages to update the layout
    # Go through MakE FN map, find out why cutting permit application is different than A15384_CP_M10_FN
    # Go through the rest of make fn map.
